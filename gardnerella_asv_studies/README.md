# Survey of *Gardnerella* 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequence variants from previously conducted studies of the vaginal microbiome in pregnancy and preterm birth

Look at the prevalence of *Gardnerella* variants accross multiple studies that used amplicon sequencing of the V4 region of the 16S rRNA to measure the vaginal microbiome in pregnancy and preterm birth.

1) `get_gardnerella_asvs.Rmd`: Used ASVs and metadata from Huang et al. "Meta-Analysis Reveals the Vaginal Microbiome is a Better Predictor of Earlier than Later Preterm Birth". Data received from author Caizhi Huang. Obtained Gardnerella ASVs, assigned taxonomy, and created a new added updated gardnerella ASVs and abundances to `./Data/multistudy_gardnerella_asvs.Rdata`.
 
2) `gardnerella_diversity.Rmd`: Analyze prevalence and abundance of Gardnerella ASVs
