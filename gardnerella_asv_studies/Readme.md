# Gardnerella 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequence variants

## Purpose
Look at the prevalence of G.vaginalis variants accross multiple studies 

## Files
1) `get_gardnerella_asvs.Rmd`: Used ASVs and metadata from Huang et al. "Meta-Analysis Reveals the Vaginal Microbiome is a Better Predictor of Earlier than Later Preterm Birth". Data received from author Caizhi Huang. Obtained Gardnerella ASVs, assigned taxonomy, and created a new added updated gardnerella ASVs and abundances to ./Data/multistudy_gardnerella_asvs.Rdata.
 
2) `gardnerella_diversity.Rmd`: Analyze prevalence and abundance of Gardnerella ASVs
