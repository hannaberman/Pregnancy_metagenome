# pregnancy_metagenome
Analysis of shotgun metagenomic data from vaginal swabs of 35 pregnant women 

## Filter Host
Filter host data with BBmap

## Methods Comparisons
Compare microbiome profiles from 16S amplicon sequencing analyzed by DADA2 to profiles from shotgun metagenome sequencing analyzed by both Metaphlan2 and Kracken2+Bracken

## Gard mapping
Assign shortreads to clades of *Gardnerella vaginalis* using a set of 72 core genes from 72 *G. vaginalis* reference genomes. (Also tested strainphlan)

## Community profiling
Functional profiling of vaginal microbiomes using Humann2
